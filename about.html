            <h2>About This Website</h2>
            <p>This website is designed as a structure-first portfolio. It is built entirely with HTML5 to demonstrate an understanding of semantic elements, meaningful content organization, and accessibility principles.</p>
            <p>No visual design, animations, or scripts are used so that the focus remains on content structure. This approach reflects how professional websites are built from the foundation upward, starting with clean markup and expanding with styling and functionality later.</p>
