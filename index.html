            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a detail-oriented web development learner and SEO content writer with practical experience in managing websites, handling structured data, and optimizing content for search engines. I have worked on both remote and office-based projects involving blogging, Amazon platforms, data entry, and customer information management. I focus on clarity, accuracy, and proper content organization. I believe a strong website starts with a clean and meaningful structure before any design or visual elements are added.</p>

            <h2>About This Website</h2>
            <p>This portfolio website is intentionally created using HTML5 only, without CSS or JavaScript. The purpose is to demonstrate a clear understanding of semantic structure, proper content hierarchy, and accessibility best practices. Visual styling and interactivity can be layered later, but this website highlights the foundation of web development.</p>
